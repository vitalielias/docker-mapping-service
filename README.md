# Dockerized Mapping Service

This repository contains a Dockerized version of the [KIT Data Manager Mapping Service](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/mapping-service/), allowing for easy deployment and local processing of files without the need for a network connection. This is particularly useful for handling large files where network transfer can become a bottleneck.

## Overview

The Mapping Service is a tool designed to map various data formats. While the service is [available online](https://matwerk.datamanager.kit.edu/mapping-service-ui.html), the Dockerized version in this repository enables local processing, thus eliminating the dependency on network speeds, which was one of the major bottlenecks.

## Getting Started

To use this Dockerized service, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system. Please refer to the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for installation instructions.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vitalielias/docker-mapping-service.git
   cd docker-mapping-service
   ```

2. Build and run the containers using Docker Compose.
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will start the backend service, initializer, and frontend containers. The initializer container will wait for the backend service to be fully operational before executing its initialization sequence. This may take a while.

### Alternative Installation

Since the image is available on the DockerHub, you may simply download this git repository and start the container by running the provided batch file to avoid interacting with the console/command line.

### Usage

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Mapping Service UI through your web browser by navigating to:

```
http://localhost
```

This will load the frontend interface, which interacts with the backend mapping service running locally on your machine.
